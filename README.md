## Policies
  1. **Attendance.** Attendance is critical. If you have extenuating circumstances that are going to keep you out of class, please inform me in advanced as early as possible.
  
  2. **Class decorum.** Treat our time in the classroom as you would meeting with the executive team or board of directors of your company. This means listening to and respecting the perspectives of your peers. It also means speaking up and disagreeing when you have a different opinion.

  3. **Technology.** Active engagement by all students is a critical part of this module, especially during our discussions. As a result, the default rule is for all laptops, tablets, phones, etc. to be muted and off the desk.
  
  If you have circumstances that require an exception to this rule, please discuss with me.

  During our "lab" style working sessions, it will often be helpful to have your laptops. I will let you know when they are needed.

  4. **Class Norms.** I would like to make explicit some norms that I hope are wholly embraced in the classroom.
      - Arrive to class on time and prepared to contribute
      - Take risks with your ideas
      - Speak in class if you have a question
      - Embrace failure and the iterative nature of learning and discovery
      - Speak up if you disagree
      - And finally, *do not* wait until you have *the perfect* comment to raise your hand and speak in class

  5. **Guests.** Guests are welcome to attend class. Friends, colleagues who are interested in the program, and family are all invited. Please let me know before class begins that you have a guest. At the start of class I will ask you to introduce the guest to your peers and I encourage the class to make our guests feel welcome. I request that you inform your guests to remain as observers in the class.

  6. **Food and Drink.** In line with the UCL School of Management norms, please refrain from bringing food or drinks (water bottles are OK) into the class.
  
## Assessment
Assessment is based on class participation, a series of individual assignments, and a team project. The deadlines and weights of each assignment are summarized in the [schedule](#schedule).

### Class Participation (20%)
Class participation takes place both inside and outside the classroom.

  1. **In-class participation.** This course depends on the participation of all the students. Active engagement promotes a more lively discussion and debate. It is in the exchange of ideas that new and interesting ways of thinking about the concepts in the course emerge. The level and quality of your participation will be part of your assessment.
  
  During some classes, students will be "warm" called to help spur discussion. Students whose names are on the board in the beginning of class are on notice and will be asked to participate in the discussion at certain points.

  2. **Outside the classroom.** Part of your class participation assessment will be your engagement with the material outside the class. Topics we discuss in class are being discussed and debated right now, all the time. To bring emerging issues and events into the classroom sphere, and to apply what we learn in the class to other cases, students are asked to engage with the material on two media: Twitter and Medium.
  
  On Twitter, use #MSING051 to highlight interesting articles or topics and your thoughts on them. If you prefer to write something a bit longer (and more tightly packaged than a Twitter thread), I have started an [MSING051](https://medium.com/msing051) publication on Medium. Responses on Twitter and commenting on Medium articles of peers also count towards class participation.

### Individual assignments (50%)
There will be two kinds of individual assignments: shorter, check-in style exercises, and longer, more in-depth assignments.

  1. **Quizzes (5%).** These quizzes will be run before four classes as a "check in" for you to guage your understanding of the material. Each quiz carries a weight of 1.25% and are largely to guage understanding of material for that session. Since it is important to check these results prior to class, they will be due at 10:00am _the day before_ class.

  2. **Assignments (45%).** Individual assessed assignments will consist of three written submissions and will due be at 10:00am on the day of class.

  If the assignment calls for the submission of presentation slides and there is a need for additional exposition, then please add a _short_ commentary to the presenter notes and submit the slides with the presenter notes.

### Team project (30%)
Over the term, students will produce a culminating project. Teams will consist of four to five students.

The project will consist of three milestones:
  
  1. **Idea generation phase (5%).** On [week 3](#week-3) a short one page document must be submitted that includes names of each team member and a brief description (approx. one to two paragraphs each) of the team's three most exciting project proposals. I will meet with each team during the week to discuss ideas and provide my advice on the prospects for the projects.
  
  2. **Initial Draft (5%).** On [week 6](#week-6), a preliminary draft of the writeup is due. This does *not* have to be a complete draft. It is meant as a forcing mechanism for you to make progress during the term and it provides you with an opportunity to receive feedback prior to the final deadline. I will meet with each team again during week 6 to discuss progress, questions, problems, etc.
  
  3. **Final project presentation/slides (10%) and writeup (10%).**  In [week 10](#week-10), each team will have the opportunity to present their work to the class and receive verbal and written feedback from students and the teaching team. Presentations will run ten to fifteen minutes. The team can then incorporate comments into their final writeup (approximately 5 pages, excluding cover page, references, works cited, etc.), which will be due at the end of the week. At the end of the writeup, there should be an explicit attribution of labor among the team members.

Your team may choose one of the three types of projects. Project types are flexible and I invite teams to craft the project that best suits their interests.
  
  1. **Data project.** You are the data team of your firm and you are presenting a research project to executive management as a means for better understanding customers, transactions, relationships between various activities of users, etc. Identify a dataset of interest to your team. Frame your study question and then conduct the appropriate analysis, provide a result and next steps (e.g. policy recommendation, follow on research agenda).
  
  2. **Data-based business proposal.** You are an entrepreneurial team and you are pitching a new business idea to an audience of startup mentors and investors. Your startup involves data-based or platform services. Craft a business plan and pay particular attention to how the concepts in this course relate to the value proposition of your startup.
  
  3. **Company/Industry report.** You are members of a consulting team being retained to report how data and analytics are transforming a specific company or industry. You will identify the subject of study and describe how data might transform it. A company study can look at the creation of a data team, the impact on management or culture, among other topics. For an industry study, you will also discuss how existing firms in the industry can best respond to the transformation as well as what new entrants with a "data-first" culture might look like. Ideally, your chosen industry is understudied in existing publications.

## Honor Code
By taking Business Strategy and Analytics at the UCL School of Management, you are agreeing to maintain a high level of professional integrity. For your work, this means citing sources wherever appropriate and producing work that is your own. Cheating, plagiarizing, or misrepresenting one's work are a violation of our classroom's aspirational norms and the university's code of conduct.

## Software
Because we focus on underlying principles, I do not require the use of any specific software or tools. For required work, it is the student's responsibility to understand the problem, identify a path towards solution, and implement that path how he or she sees fit.

Having said that, there are a number of applications and environments that I will mention here as being available to students and used in industry.

- [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.org/knime-analytics-platform).
- [Amazon Web Services Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/). Cloud based machine learning platform. Education accounts can be set up to get started.
- [Microsoft Cloud Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/). Alternative cloud platform. Education accounts available.
- [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/). Data visualization tool.
- [Grid](https://quid.com). Online platform for topic clustering.

If you intend on using a programming language to produce your work, I highly suggest R and/or Python. Each has its comparative strengths and those most immersed in analytics in industry typically work with both languages. Here are a few resources for each:
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Model Analytics Python Tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/)
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
