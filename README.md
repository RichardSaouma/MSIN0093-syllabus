## Policies
  1. **Attendance.** Attendance is critical. If you have extenuating circumstances that are going to keep you out of class, please inform me in advanced as early as possible.
  
  1. **Class decorum.** Treat our time in the classroom as you would meeting with the executive team or board of directors of your company. This means listening to and respecting the perspectives of your peers. It also means speaking up and disagreeing when you have a different opinion.

  In line with the classroom as a boardroom theme (and in keeping with school rules), I ask you to refrain from bringing food or drinks (water bottles are OK) into the class. I suggest eating lunch a bit before class and then eating a snack during the break.
  
  1. **Participation.** This course depends on the participation of all the students. Active engagement promotes a more lively discussion and debate. It is in the exchange of ideas that new and interesting ways of thinking about the concepts in the course emerge.

  With that in mind, I will cold call in class. I understand that some people may find public speaking challenging for a variety of reasons. If this is the case, please see me.

  1. **Technology.** Active engagement by all students is a critical part of this module. As a result, the default rule is for all laptops, tablets, phones, etc. to be muted and off the desk. Moreover, recording classroom lectures or discussion is not allowed.

  If you have circumstances that require an exception to this rule, please discuss with me.

  If any devices are required for part of a class, I will let you know ahead of time.

  1. **Class Norms.** I would like to make explicit some norms that I hope are wholly embraced in the classroom.
    - Arrive to class on time and prepared to contribute
    - Take risks with your ideas
    - Speak in class if you have a question
    - Embrace failure and the iterative nature of learning and discovery
    - Speak up if you disagree
    - And finally, do NOT wait until you have the *perfect* comment to raise your hand and speak in class

  1. **Guests.** Guests are welcome to attend class. Friends, colleagues who are interested in the program, and family are all invited. Please let me know before class begins that you have a guest. At the start of class I will ask you to introduce the guest to your peers and I encourage the class to make our guests feel welcome. I request that you inform your guests to remain as observers in the class.

## Assessment
Assessment will be based on a series of individual assignments and a team project.

### Individual assignments (60%)
Individual coursework consists of two components: assignments and mini-presentations. See [Summary of Submission Deadlines](#summary-of-submission-deadlines) for times and weights of individual assignments.

  1. **Assessed Assignments (55%).** Individual assessed assignments will consist of 2 page write ups or 3-6 slides due 24 hours prior to the start of class.

  In addition to the assessed assignments, there will be check-in homeworks, consisting of 2-5 slides. Students are allowed to work in pairs and submit a single assignment. However, you may only work with the same partner for two assignments. Note these homeworks will *not* be assessed, but you may be asked to present your work in a mini-presentation (see below)!

  For the slides assignments, if there is a need for additional exposition on to support the content on the slide, then add a _short_ commentary to the presenter notes and submit the slides with the presenter notes.

  2. **Mini-presentations (5%).** Students will be selected for in-class presentations of these submissions. The presentation will run for approximately five minutes. Each student will present at least once, and ideally three to five times during the course.

### Team project (40%)
Over the term, students will produce a culminating project. Teams will consist of four to five students.

The project will consist of three milestones:
  
  1. **Idea generation phase (5%).** Before class on [week 3](#week-3-18-oct) a short one page document must be submitted that includes names of each team member and a brief description (approx one paragraph each) of the team's three most exciting ideas. I will meet with each team during the week to discuss ideas and provide my advice on the prospects for the projects.
  
  2. **Initial Draft (10%).** Before class on [week 6](#week-6-8-nov), a preliminary draft of the writeup is due. This does *not* have to be a complete draft. It is meant as a forcing mechanism for you to make progress during the term and it provides you with an opportunity to receive feedback prior to the final deadline. I will meet with each team again during week 6 to discuss progress, questions, problems, etc.
  
  3. **Final project presentation/slides (10%) and writeup (15%).**  In [week 10](#week-10-6-dec), each team will have the opportunity to present their work to the class and receive verbal and written feedback from students and the teaching team. Presentations will run approximately 20 minutes. The team can then incorporate comments into their final writeup (approximately 5 pages, excluding cover page, references, works cited, etc.), which will be due at the end of the week. At the end of the writeup, there should be an explicit attribution of labor among the team members.

Your team may choose one of the three types of projects:
  
  1. **Data project.** You are the data team of your firm and you are presenting a research project to the executive team as a means for better understanding customers, transactions, relationships between various activities of users, etc. Identify a dataset of interest to your team. Frame your study question and then conduct the appropriate analysis, provide a result and next steps (e.g. policy recommendation, follow on research agenda).
  
  1. **Data-based business proposal.** You are an entrepreneurial team and you are pitching a new business idea to an audience of startup mentors and investors. Your startup involves data-based or platform services. Craft a business plan and pay particular attention to how the concepts in this course relate to the value hypothesis of your startup.
  
  1. **Company/Industry report.** You are members of a consulting team being retained to report how data and analytics are transforming a specific company or industry. You will identify the subject of study and describe how data might transform it. For a company study, the study can look at the creation of a data team, the impact on management or culture, among other topics. For an industry study, students will also discuss how existing firms in the industry can best respond to the transformation as well as what new entrants with a "data-first" culture might look like. Ideally, your chosen industry is understudied in existing public forums.

## Honor Code
By taking Business Strategy and Analytics at the UCL School of Management, you are agreeing to maintain a high level of professional integrity. For your work, this means citing sources wherever appropriate and producing work that is your own. Cheating, plagiarizing, or misrepresenting one's work are a violation of our classroom's aspirational norms and the university's code of conduct.

## Software
Because we focus on underlying principles, I do not require the use of any specific software or tools. For required work, it is the student's responsibility to understand the problem, identify a path towards solution, and implement that path how he or she sees fit.

Having said that, there are a number of applications and environments that I will mention here as being available to students and used in industry.

- **[KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.org/knime-analytics-platform).** A free to download graphic-based application for data analysis. Digital copies of [KNIME Beginner's Luck](https://www.knime.org/knimepress/beginners-luck) are available for students with the appropriate code.
- **[Amazon Web Services Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/).** Cloud based machine learning platform. Education accounts can be set up to get started.
- **[Microsot Cloud Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/).** Alternative cloud platform. Education accounts available.
- **[Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/).** Data visualization tool. One year license is available to students.
- **[Grid](https://quid.com).** Online platform for topic clustering.

If you intend on using a programming language to produce your work, I highly suggest R and/or Python. Each has its comparative strengths and those most immersed in analytics in industry typically work with both languages. Here are a few resources for each:
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Model Analytics Python Tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/)
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
